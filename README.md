# Java-HW-2
Coding assignment #2 for my Java 360 course

1. (Occurrence of max numbers) Write a program that reads integers, finds the largest of them, and counts its occurrences. Assume the input ends with number 0. Suppose you entered 3 5 2 5 5 5 0; the program finds that the largest is 5 and the occurrence count for 5 is 4.

Enter numbers: 3 5 2 5 5 5 0 
The largest number is 5
The occurrence count of the largest number is 4


2. Write a program using nested loops that displays the following pattern:
                1
              2 1
            3 2 1
          4 3 2 1
        5 4 3 2 1
      6 5 4 3 2 1
    7 6 5 4 3 2 1
  8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


3. (Reverse a string) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and displays the string in reverse order. 
Enter a string: ABCD
The reversed string is DCBA


4. (Count) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and displays the number of vowels and consonants as well as the number of uppercase and lowercase characters in the string.

Sample run:
Enter a string: Manhattan College
The number of vowels is 6
The number of consonants is 10
The number of uppercase characters is 2
The number of lowercase characters is 14
